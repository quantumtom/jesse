    <p>Jesse Kirschner began his career at the Vidal Sassoon Academy in Santa Monica in 2004, furthering his studies with the Sassoon Creative Team, Hikari, Bumble & Bumble, and TG, with a focus on the art of cutting and styling.</p>
    <p>His signature philosophy, Inside-Out, is a unique approach to hair design that connects with a person’s natural hair movement through multi-dimensional dry cutting techniques that build internal structure.</p>
    <p>Each cut is entirely unique—thoughtfully designed and precisely tailored to highlight an individual’s natural attributes and character. Jesse approaches color with the same philosophy: balancing, enhancing, and complementing the existing spectrum for a natural-looking, lived-in result that grows out seamlessly and beautifully.</p>
